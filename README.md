# 351VirtualMemory
On saturday, the 27th, Jimena and I will make the header file with all the classes and functions we will need.
After that, we will all be assigned individual pieces to do and have done by a specified date. This README will be updated when all of these decisions are made.

Make sure you have all the cpp and both .h files, as well as the .txt and .bin when we start using
Commands to do in linux terminal:
g++ -g3 -O0 -std=c++17 -pedantic -Wall -Wold-stle-cast -Wextra -Woverloaded-virtual -I./ -o VMManager hw.cpp HARDWARE.h OS.h 

./VMManager <addresses.txt 2)&1 | tee output.txt
